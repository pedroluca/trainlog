```
PWA works automatically! Service worker is served correctly.

### Firebase Hosting
```bash
firebase deploy
```
Make sure `firebase.json` includes service worker:
```json
{
  "hosting": {
    "headers": [
      {
        "source": "/sw.js",
        "headers": [
          {
            "key": "Service-Worker-Allowed",
            "value": "/"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## 📊 Monitoring PWA Performance

### Lighthouse Audit
1. Open DevTools → Lighthouse tab
2. Select "Progressive Web App" category
3. Run audit
4. Aim for 90+ score

### Key Metrics to Track
- **Install rate**: How many users install?
- **Offline usage**: Do users access offline?
- **Update adoption**: Do users update quickly?
- **Retention**: Do installed users return more?

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Install button not showing
- Check console for errors
- Verify manifest.json is valid
- Make sure HTTPS is enabled (required for PWA)
- Clear cache and reload

### Service worker not updating
- Go to DevTools → Application → Service Workers
- Click "Update on reload"
- Click "Unregister" and reload
- Service worker will re-register with new version

### Offline mode not working
- Check if service worker is registered
- Verify network requests in DevTools → Network tab
- Check cache storage in Application → Cache Storage

## 🎯 Best Practices

1. **Always test offline** before deploying
2. **Version your service worker** (happens automatically)
3. **Monitor cache size** (don't cache too much)
4. **Test on real devices** (mobile and desktop)
5. **Update regularly** but don't force updates

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
